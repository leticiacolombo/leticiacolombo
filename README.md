Hello, I'm Leticia, from Brazil and I'm gratuated at Computer Engneering.
Currently I work as a full-stack developer with PHP, MySQL and AngularJS, but in my free time I'm studying VUE.js.

Here are some (fun) facts about me:

- 🐶 I love cats and dogs
- 💻 I started to format some computers when I was 10 to help my dad cause it was his work
- 🐢 When I was a child I let a tortoise run away from me (it's true)
- 📜 It has been 10 years I started to study programming
- 👧 People think I am almost 8 years younger then I really am
- 🥚 Twitter is the social network that I spend more time (follow me [@itisleticia_](https://twitter.com/itisleticia_))
- 📚 I'm scared about horror movies but thriller's books are my favorites (?)
